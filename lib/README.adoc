I do not put any .jar here since it makes this dist fat. You should go
to the internet and fetch all .jar needed by this dist:

- TuProlog 3.0.0. Get file +*tuprolog.jar*+, change into
  +*tuprolog-3.0.0.jar*+. You may get the file from https://bitbucket.org/tuprologteam/tuprolog/downloads[TuProlog
repository]
